<h3 style="color:blue"> Part A: OpenMP Programs</h3>

1. Sort an array of n elements using both sequential and parallel merge sort (using Section). Record the difference in execution time.
2. Estimate the value of pi using
π = 4 ∑k=0∞ (-1)k / (2k + 1)
parallel programming. Record both serial and parallel execution times.
3. Write an OpenMP program that divides the iterations into chunks containing 2 iterations (OMP_SCHEDULE=static,2). Output which iterations of a parallelized for loop are executed by which thread.
4. Calculate n Fibonacci numbers using Parallel Directive. Eliminate the race condition using Schedule directive.
5. Find the prime numbers from 1 to n using parallel for directive. Record both serial and parallel execution times.
6. Parallel Vector Addition
7. Calculate the sum of the first 100 numbers using the critical directive.
